					Here’s some text that I’ve written about myself
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a CELTA-qualified teacher and I've been teaching English since 2013. Teaching became my profession when I started giving Music Production class in my local high school, I found it incredibly rewarding to help people develop their skills. Though music and English are both forms of communication, I needed to study hard when I switched to English teaching. My attitude is that students deserve a teacher that makes an effort to learn to teach, if they are making an effort to learn how to learn.<br><br>I have worked in many international schools and in-company with business students to give group classes, and online, 1-to-1 with students to deliver lessons. Working with group classes was a great introduction to the English teaching world, but it frustrated me that I couldn’t spend time helping each student as much as they needed. Moving to 1-to-1&nbsp;classes has enabled me to specialise in analysing each individual students strengths, weaknesses and learning style,&nbsp;so I can change my lessons and teaching style to suit the needs of the student. Often, language schools are simply businesses that prioritise profit over education. This doesn’t fit well with my personality, ethics or way of working. I design a programme of lessons that I believe will help you progress. You will study all the important aspects of English; speaking, listening, reading and writing, according to your needs.<br><br>Each student learns differently, and each student learns for different reasons. All of my classes are created especially for the student, with your learning goals in mind. Some students have a specific goal, a Cambridge exam for example, others are simply looking for an encouraging environment to improve their communication.&nbsp;My aim is to push you to your next level, whatever that may be, in an environment that you can have fun in! I think it’s vitally important for students to enjoy their classes, so many people struggle with classes because they don’t enjoy the company of their classmates, or teacher. This is why it’s important to find out if you match well with your teacher (me?), I don’t see myself as an authority figure whose advice must be obeyed! I’m more like your knowledgeable friend, whose advice you appreciate (I hope!) because they have spent a long time researching and studying the topic.&nbsp;<br><br>I try to make good use of the technology available to me to share materials with you via skype, zoom, etc. on your screen. This means you don't need to buy any extra books or materials. I send my students a PDF of all the materials and exercises that we do in class, and any notes that I have made, after the lesson finishes. This includes homework tasks (if you want them!) that are designed to practice the topics we have covered, or real-world exam tasks to help you prepare. Feedback and homework correction, including essay-grading, are all included in the lesson price.<br><br>If you think that lessons with me sound interesting, but you’d like to know more, why not ask me a question? Or better still, book a trial meeting, we can meet and discuss your needs and you can see how the lessons work.

					• Here&rsquo;s some text that I&rsquo;ve written about myself
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a CELTA-qualified teacher and I've been teaching English since 2013. Teaching became my profession when I started giving Music Production class in my local high school, I found it incredibly rewarding to help people develop their skills. Though music and English are both forms of communication, I needed to study hard when I switched to English teaching. My attitude is that students deserve a teacher that makes an effort to learn to teach, if they are making an effort to learn how to learn.<br><br>I have worked in many international schools and in-company with business students to give group classes, and online, 1-to-1 with students to deliver lessons. Working with group classes was a great introduction to the English teaching world, but it frustrated me that I couldn&rsquo;t spend time helping each student as much as they needed. Moving to 1-to-1&nbsp;classes has enabled me to specialise in analysing each individual students strengths, weaknesses and learning style,&nbsp;so I can change my lessons and teaching style to suit the needs of the student. Often, language schools are simply businesses that prioritise profit over education. This doesn&rsquo;t fit well with my personality, ethics or way of working. I design a programme of lessons that I believe will help you progress. You will study all the important aspects of English; speaking, listening, reading and writing, according to your needs.<br><br>Each student learns differently, and each student learns for different reasons. All of my classes are created especially for the student, with your learning goals in mind. Some students have a specific goal, a Cambridge exam for example, others are simply looking for an encouraging environment to improve their communication.&nbsp;My aim is to push you to your next level, whatever that may be, in an environment that you can have fun in! I think it&rsquo;s vitally important for students to enjoy their classes, so many people struggle with classes because they don&rsquo;t enjoy the company of their classmates, or teacher. This is why it&rsquo;s important to find out if you match well with your teacher (me?), I don&rsquo;t see myself as an authority figure whose advice must be obeyed! I&rsquo;m more like your knowledgeable friend, whose advice you appreciate (I hope!) because they have spent a long time researching and studying the topic.&nbsp;<br><br>I try to make good use of the technology available to me to share materials with you via skype, zoom, etc. on your screen. This means you don't need to buy any extra books or materials. I send my students a PDF of all the materials and exercises that we do in class, and any notes that I have made, after the lesson finishes. This includes homework tasks (if you want them!) that are designed to practice the topics we have covered, or real-world exam tasks to help you prepare. Feedback and homework correction, including essay-grading, are all included in the lesson price.<br><br>If you think that lessons with me sound interesting, but you&rsquo;d like to know more, why not ask me a question? Or better still, book a trial meeting, we can meet and discuss your needs and you can see how the lessons work.

					• Methodology<br>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Every business wants to tell you how their product is better than all the competition. Unfortunately, the world of English teaching is not much different; every school, every app, every teacher has a ‘method&rsquo; that they insist is revolutionising the way people learn. All their techniques are valid, and surely help many students, but they also fail to help many others.<br><br>I use what is often called the&nbsp;<i>communicative approach/method</i>. The basis for this is that students learn by having to communicate in a <strong>meaningful</strong> way. Repetition is very important when trying to memorise something, but language without communication is not very useful, so I encourage students to express their thougts and opinions by giving them the tools to do so. Sometimes students lack the grammar to express the meaning they want, sometimes it&rsquo;s vocabulary. <br>Other times, making the sounds of the English language can be the issue. And for everybody, gradually being able to follow native speakers, speaking naturally, is a great challenge. My idea, is that step by step, we can add useful knowledge that will help you do all of these things to the best of your ability.<br><br>What this means in terms of classroom activities, is that we won&rsquo;t spend all of our time doing just one thing. There will be speaking and listening, with reading and writing tasks often set for homework. When we encounter new grammar or vocabulary, it will be presented to you in a way that (I hope) you can relate to, that is relevant to your life.<br><br>The internet has enabled students to access a huge library of resources, the best opportunity to learn that the world has ever seen. But it can be difficult for students to know where to start, or how to improve after studying alone for a long time. My job is to assess what you do well and what you can improve on, and create a program that will help you fill in the gaps.<br><br>Teaching involves (almost) as much learning as being a student, the same resources that are available for students, are available for teachers, too. We have to be proactive and interested in developing our skills, so that we can best help our students. Obviously, I&rsquo;m not perfect, but I try my best to do my best!

					• Who are you, really?<br>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Well, now you&rsquo;re asking the difficult questions. I could avoid this topic, but I think it&rsquo;s really important for students to know what their teacher is like, professionally and personally. You have so much choice now, so many teachers to chose from, you can be fussy about who you choose to spend you time (and money) on.<br>I mentioned eariler on that I&rsquo;m British, I was born in London and lived there for the early years of my life. In 2013, I managed to finally escape from the UK and moved to Uruguay. The experience of being a foreigner that didn&rsquo;t speak the language very well was eye-opening, it&rsquo;s helped me to be empathetic and patient with my students; I know I&rsquo;d need people to be patient with me when I speak Spanish!<br>Now, after travelling to Spain, Ireland and back to the UK, I live in Amsterdam. The Netherlands is a great country and I&rsquo;m very lucky to live here, it&rsquo;s also a very expensive country, which is the reason for my prices to be as they are.&nbsp;<br>Outside of teaching English, I&rsquo;m primarily interested in music. When I was younger, I played in bands and made records. Even though I don&rsquo;t have many opportunities to play anymore, I&rsquo;m still interested in playing when I can.<br>I&rsquo;m not a religious person, but I am a tolerant person. I respect anybody&rsquo;s decisions over their own lives, provided they don&rsquo;t influence mine.Having said that, I don&rsquo;t tolerate racist, homophobic, mysoginistic or otherwise discriminatory opinions in my classroom. It&rsquo;s my opinion that people who have those views don&rsquo;t deserve my attention, even if they&rsquo;re paying me for it.<br>My football team is Norwich City. If you know who they are, then you know you need to feel sorry for me.
